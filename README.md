# Franz Recipes
This repository contains several franz recipes that I personally use.

## Install
There is a install.sh script located in the root of this repository that will install of the recipes in Franz 5.
* To install Franz 5, it can be installed from here: https://meetfranz.com/
* Run the install.sh script which will copy all recipes into the metadata in the users home directory: `~Library/Application Support/Franz/recipes/dev/`
